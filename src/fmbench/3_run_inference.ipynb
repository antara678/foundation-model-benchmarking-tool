    "## Run Inference on all deployed endpoints: Various combinations of payloads, concurrency levels, model configurations\n",
    "---------------------\n",
    "*This notebook works best with the conda_python3 kernel on a ml.t3.medium machine*.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### This step of our solution design includes running inferences on all deployed model endpoints (with different configurations, concurrency levels and payload sizes). This notebook runs inferences in a manner that is calls endpoints concurrently and asychronously to generate responses and record metrics. Here are some of the key components:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Accessing the deployed endpoints**, creating a predictor object for these endpoints to call them during inference time.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Functions to define metrics**: This notebook sets stage for metrics to be recorded during the time of invocation of all these models for benchmarking purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Running Actual Inferences**: Once the metrics are defined, we set a blocker function that is responsible for creating inference on a single payload called get_inference. We then run a series of asynchronous functions that can be viewed in the code (link above), to create asychronous inferefences on the deployed models. The way we send requests are by creating combinations: this means creating combinations of payloads of different sizes that can be viewed in the config.yml file, with different concurrency levels (in this case we first go through all patches of payloads with a concurrency level of 1, then 2, and then 4). You can set this to your desired value."
