It was released on 25 November in 1977 by RSO Records. The release, titled after Clapton's nickname, is to this date one of his both commercially and musically most successful studio albums. Slowhand produced the two hit singles \"Lay Down Sally\" and \"Wonderful Tonight\", reached various international music charts and was honored with numerous awards and recording certifications. In 2012, a deluxe edition was released to celebrate the album's 35th anniversary.\n\nRecording\n\nClapton wanted to work with record producer Glyn Johns, because he thought Johns produced great work with famous groups like The Rolling Stones and The Eagles and understands how to work with both British and American musicians. While in the studio with Johns, Clapton notes that the A-list producer was very disciplined and disliked jamming, because it would kill important recording time. Although Clapton and his band were either drunk or stoned nearly all the time when recording, Johns liked Clapton's work and brought out the best in every musician, according to Clapton. \n\nTitle and artwork\n\nThe album was titled after Clapton's nickname, which was given to him by Giorgio Gomelsky. In his 2007 autobiography, Clapton recalled that the name \"Slowhand\" seemed to be hanging on to his real name, because it seemed to be well received by both his American friends and fans who think of the wild west when hearing the nickname. The album's artwork was done by Clapton himself with the help of Pattie Boyd and Dave Stewart, credited as \"El & Nell Ink\". Besides choosing various photos for the inner side of the gramophone record packaging are two pictures, Clapton notes, which have deeper importance to him: one picture, in which he kisses Boyd and another photograph showing a demolished Ferrari 365 GT4 BB, which Clapton bought after seeing George Harrison turning up with the same model at his Hurtwood Edge Estate. The car, which has been involved with Clapton in a car accident after the British recording artist finished touring in Australia, nearly killed him.\n\nRelease and reception\n\nSlowhand was released on 25 November 1977 by RSO Records.  In a contemporary review for Rolling Stone, John Swenson found Clapton's playing more subtle than before but his songs sobering and interesting psychologically, especially \"Next Time You See Her\", as they showed him \"in touch with the horrible moral power and long-suffering self-righteousness that is the essence of the blues\".  Robert Christgau was less enthusiastic, lamenting how most of the record's best guitar solos were played by George Terry and feeling Clapton had regressed as a singer, \"sounding like he's blown his voice. Doing what, I wonder.\"\n\nIn a retrospective review for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote that the confident, virtuosic quality in the band's playing and the diversity of the songwriting made Slowhand \"rank with 461 Ocean Boulevard as Eric Clapton's best albums\". Yahoo! Music's Dave DiMartino said the record was full of hits and \"tasteful\" music.  In 2003, Slowhand was ranked number 325 on Rolling Stones list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. \n\nCensure in Argentina\n\nThe rock song \"Cocaine\" was censored and removed from the Argentinian edition of the album in late 1977. The military government of the time claimed that the song Clapton recorded was harmful to young people and inviting them to get high. The ban was finally lifted in 1984. Clapton felt indignation in later years after learning of censorship, since \"Cocaine\" is a song which is against drugs, and not to please as many people think. The musician once said that it is useless to intentionally write a song that goes against drugs and hope that people grasp the meaning. In \"Cocaine,\" an anti-drug perspective is communicated more effectively through an honest song whose cautionary message is apparent upon reflection.  After several years, Clapton began including the phrase 'that dirty cocaine' in live performances to highlight the anti-drug message of the song.  In addition, Clapton donated much of their funds to Crossroads Centre, a center that helps drug addicts to fight to stop drugs and rehabilitate themselves. \n\nDeluxe Edition\n\nIn November 2012, a remastered two-compact-disc 35th anniversary deluxe edition of Slowhand was released. The first disc consists of the remastered album, with additional bonus tracks and studio jam sessions. The second disc features a previously unreleased live concert, recorded in April 1977 at the Hammersmith Odeon; although the concert is of the same era as the Slowhand sessions, it was performed prior to the album's recording and release, and so does not include any of the album's tracks. \n\nTrack listings\n\nOriginal release\n\n2012 Deluxe edition\n\nPersonnel\n\n*Eric Clapton \u2013 lead vocals, guitar\n*Jamie Oldaker \u2013 drums, percussion\n*Carl Radle \u2013 bass guitar\n*Dick Sims \u2013 keyboards\n*George Terry \u2013 guitar\n\n*Mel Collins \u2013 saxophone\n*Yvonne Elliman \u2013 harmony and backing vocals\n*Marcy Levy \u2013 harmony and backing vocals, duet on 'The Core'\n*Glyn Johns \u2013 producer, engineer\n*El & Nell Ink. \u2013 Art design\n\nChart positions\n\nWeekly charts\n\nYear-end charts\n\nCertifications\nQuestion:\nWhich guitarist is known as Slowhand?\nAnswer:\nErick Clapton\nPassage:\nRed Lake Mine\nThe Red Lake mine is one of the largest gold mines in Canada and in the world.  The mine is located in northwestern Ontario at Red Lake. The mine has estimated reserves of 3.23 million oz of gold.\n\nThe Red Lake Mining District has produced over 22 million ounces of gold through 2004, worth over $US 35 billion at 2014 prices. The two principal mines, Campbell and Red Lake, both have historic ore grades averaging about 0.57 oz/ton Au (22 g/tonne). \n\nThe rocks and mineralization features in this district are complex. The host rock here is a metamorphosed tholeiitic basalt dating to ~2.85 billion years (early Neoarchean). This basalt has been subjected to biotite-carbonate alteration and auriferous silicification. Gold mineralization has been dated to 2.712-2.723 billion years (during collision-related emplacement of several nearby igneous intrusions - Uchian Phase of the Kenoran Orogeny), and  at 2.63-2.66 or 2.699 billion years (during a regional thermal event or another igneous intrusive event).\nQuestion:\nThe Red Lake Mine, said to produce the richest gold ore in the world is in which country?\nAnswer:\nCanada\n\n```\n\nQuestion: Passage:\nUK Inquiry releases damning verdict on Iraq War - CNN Video\nUK Inquiry releases damning verdict on Iraq War - CNN Video\nUK Inquiry releases damning verdict on Iraq War\nMUST WATCH\nUK Inquiry releases damning verdict on Iraq War\nChairman of UK Iraq inquiry John Chilcot says the basis for the decisions that lead Great Britain into the Iraq War were \"far from satisfactory.\"\nQuestion:\nWho lead the enquiry into the Iraq war?\nAnswer:\n\n\n[/INST]\nAnswer:",
