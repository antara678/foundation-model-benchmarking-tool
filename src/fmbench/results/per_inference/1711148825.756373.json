Originally titled Get Fell In, the film was renamed to match Trinder's familiar catchphrase. It was shot in a rival French process to CinemaScope, called 'CameraScope', with the attendant publicity describing \"the first feature to be made with an anamorphic lens in black and white! It's a camerascoop!\". \n\nPlot\n\nAn intake of civilian reservists arrive at army camp to do their two weeks refresher training.\n\nPartial cast\n\n* Tommy Trinder as Tommy Smart\n* Mary Parker as Private Sally Briggs\n* Dora Bryan as Sergeant Hortense Tipp\n* R.S.M.

It is a type of rice wine similar to sake, but with a lower alcohol content and higher sugar content.  The sugar content is a complex carbohydrate formed naturally via the fermentation process; it is not refined sugar. The alcohol content is further lowered when the liquid is heated.\n\nThere are three general types of mirin. The first is hon mirin (literally: true mirin),  which contains approximately 14% alcohol and is  produced by a forty- to sixty-day mashing (saccharification) process.   The second is shio mirin, which contains alcohol as low as 1.5% to avoid alcohol tax.  The third is shin mirin (literally: new mirin),  or mirin-fu chomiryo (literally: mirin-like seasoning), which contains less than 1% alcohol yet retains the same flavor.\n\nIn the Edo period, mirin was consumed as Amazake.  Otoso, traditionally consumed on Sh\u014dgatsu, can be made by soaking a spice mixture in mirin. \n\nIn the Kansai style of cooking, mirin is briefly boiled before using, to allow some of the alcohol to evaporate, while in the Kant\u014d regional style, the mirin is used untreated. Kansai-style boiled mirin is called nikiri mirin ()  (literally: thoroughly boiled mirin).\n\nMirin is used to add a bright touch to grilled (broiled) fish or to erase the fishy smell. A small amount is often used instead of sugar and soy sauce. It should not be used in excess, however, as its flavor is quite strong. It is sometimes used to accompany sushi. Mirin is used in teriyaki sauce. \n\nNovember 30 has been designated the Day of hon-mirin by the mirin industry because in Japanese wordplay the date words sound like '11' (, good) and '30' (, mirin).\nQuestion:\nMirin is a type of wine used for flavouring the cuisine of which country?\nAnswer:\n\u65e5\u672c\u570b\n\n```\n\nQuestion: Passage:\nNaismith Legacy Awards \u2014 Naismith.com\nNaismith Legacy Awards \u2014 Naismith.com\nGet in Touch\nWhat is the purpose of the Naismith Legacy Award?\nThe Naismith Legacy Award is presented to players, coaches and other individuals or organizations from the game of basketball honoring their role in furthering the values of Honor, Respect and Integrity, both on and off the court.
