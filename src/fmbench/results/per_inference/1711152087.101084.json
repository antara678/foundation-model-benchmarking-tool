It was discovered from the images taken by Voyager 2 on 3 January 1986, and was given the temporary designation S/1986\u00a0U\u00a02. It is named after the heroine of William Shakespeare's play Romeo and Juliet. It is also designated Uranus\u00a0XI.\n\nJuliet belongs to Portia Group of satellites, which also includes Bianca, Cressida, Desdemona, Portia, Rosalind, Cupid, Belinda and Perdita. These satellites have similar orbits and photometric properties. Unfortunately, other than its orbit, radius of 53\u00a0km and geometric albedo of 0.08 virtually nothing is known about Juliet.\n\nAt the Voyager 2 images Juliet appears as an elongated object, the major axis pointing towards Uranus. The ratio of axes of Juliet's prolate spheroid is 0.5 \u00b1 0.3, which is rather an extreme value. Its surface is grey in color.\n\nJuliet may collide with Desdemona within the next 100 million years.\nQuestion:\nJuliet, Cupid and Desdemona are moons of which planet?\nAnswer:\nMagnetosphere of Uranus\nPassage:\nBlack Canyon of the Colorado\nThe Black Canyon of the Colorado is the canyon on the Colorado River where Hoover Dam was built. The canyon is located on the Colorado River at the state line between Nevada and Arizona. The western wall of the gorge is in the El Dorado Mountains, and the eastern wall is in the Black Mountains of Arizona. The canyon formed about 15 million years ago during the Miocene Basin and Range uplift.[http://www.birdandhike.com/Wilderness/BlackCyn/_Black.htm Black Canyon Wilderness Area] Information on Black Canyon and its natural history. Black Canyon gets its name from the black volcanic rocks that are found throughout the area.\n\nJust south of the Hoover Dam on the Nevada side of the canyon is the Sauna Cave. This cave was drilled by miners working on Hoover Dam while it was being constructed. It is a deep cave with calcium carbonate crystals on the walls. At the end of the cave is a hot spring, which causes temperatures in the cave to reach 120 F.\n\nOne prominent canyon that splits from this canyon south of the Hoover Dam is Boy Scout Canyon. Boy Scout Canyon has water running through it that is warmed from a geothermal source.\n\nOn the Arizona side of the river, there are several large hot springs that can be found by taking a trail north from a larger bay about 4 to south of the Hoover Dam.\nQuestion:\nWhat is the dam in the Black Canyon of the Colorado River on the border between the US states of Arizona and Nevada that was completed in 1935?\nAnswer:\nBoulder Canyon Project\n\n```\n\nQuestion: Passage:\nHow to Make Triple Sec - Thursday Happy Hour\nHow to Make Triple Sec - Thursday Happy Hour\nHow to Make Triple Sec\nPosted by Shelly Bowen on Oct 8, 2009 in Handcrafted Mixers , How to ... | No Comments\nWhen it comes to mixing fantastic drinks, fewer things make it better than having the best ingredients on hand. Triple sec or orange liqueur (or Grand Marnier or Cointreau, both orange liqueurs) is widely used in many classics, so we made own special version.\nWhat does triple sec taste like? Triple sec is a sweet orange citrus liqueur. Our homemade triple sec tastes heavily of oranges and orange peel, like orange hard candy. Some triple secs are not as potently orange tasting.\nThis recipe comes from Charlie Hodges at the Ace Hotel, Palm Springs, via Imbibe Magazine\u2018s Fall 2009 issue. Read through the steps and you\u2019ll see that you can multitask to speed up the process.\nHere\u2019s what you need to make triple sec:\n4 small navel oranges\n12 oz. Everclear grain alcohol\n12 oz. vodka\n12 oz. can of Mandarin orange slices\n5 cups cane sugar\nOrange blossom water\nGet all your triple sec ingredients together, then:\nHeat oven to lowest temperature setting, generally around 180\u00baF \u2013 200\u00baF. Slice the oranges into 1/8\u2033 thick wheels and lay out on a baking tray. Bake oranges until sticky and gummy but not dried, about 1-2 hours.\nDrain the can of Mandarin oranges and place in a jar with the vodka to infuse for about 24 hours or until it tastes strongly of the oranges.\nCombine the baked orange slices with the Everclear and infuse for 8 hours, stirring occasionally.\nMake the simple syrup combining the sugar and water and stirring over medium heat until dissolved.\nFinally, strain all liquid ingredients through a fine sieve and combine with the syrup. Stir and add a few dashes of orange blossom water to taste. Bottle it up and it keeps refrigerated for about a month.\nReady to mix? Here are some mixed drink recipes that call for triple sec.\nQuestion:\nWhat is the flavour of the liqueur Triple-Sec?\nAnswer:\n\n\n[/INST]\nAnswer:",
