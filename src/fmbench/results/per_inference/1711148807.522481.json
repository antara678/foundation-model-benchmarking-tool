And they call the blind man, saying unto him, Be of good comfort, rise; he calleth thee. 50 And he, casting away his garment, rose, and came to Jesus.\n51 And Jesus answered and said unto him, What wilt thou that I should do unto thee? The blind man said unto him, Lord, that I might receive my sight. 52 And Jesus said unto him, Go thy way; thy faith hath made thee whole. And immediately he received his sight, and followed Jesus in the way.\nCompare: Matthew 20:29-34; Luke 18:35-43\nJesus, Son of David?\nJericho is on the way to Jerusalem for Jesus, but apparently nothing of interest happened while he was there. Upon leaving, however, Jesus encountered another blind man who had faith that he would be able to cure his blindness. This isn\u0092t the first time Jesus cured a blind man and it\u0092s unlikely that this incident was meant to be read any more literally than previous ones.\nI wonder why, at the beginning, people tried to stop the blind man from calling out to Jesus. I\u0092m sure that he must have had quite a reputation as a healer by this point \u0097 enough of one that the blind man himself was obviously well aware of who he was and what he might be able to do. If that is the case, then why would people try to stop him? Could it have anything to do with him being in Judea \u0097 is it possible that the people here are not happy about Jesus?\nIt should be noted that this is one of the few times so far that Jesus has been identified with Nazareth. In fact, the only other two times so far came during the first chapter. In verse nine we can read \u0093 Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee \u0094 and then later when Jesus is casting out unclean spirits in Capernaum , one of the spirits identifies him as \u0093thou Jesus of Nazareth.\u0094 This blind man, then, is only the second to ever identify Jesus as such \u0097 and he\u0092s not exactly in good company.\nThis is also the first time that Jesus is identified as a \u0093son of David.\u0094 It was foretold that the Messiah would come from the House of David, but so far Jesus\u0092 lineage has not been mentioned at all (Mark is the gospel without any information about Jesus\u0092 family and birth). It seems reasonable to conclude that Mark had to introduce that bit of information at some point and this is as good as any. The reference may also harken back to David returning to Jerusalem to claim his kingdom as described in 2 Samuel 19-20.\nIsn\u0092t it odd that Jesus asks him what he wants? Even if Jesus weren\u0092t God (and, therefore, omniscient ), but simply a miracle worker wandering around curing people\u0092s ailments, it has to be obvious to him what a blind man rushing up to him might want. Isn\u0092t it rather demeaning to force the man to say it? Does he just want people in the crowd to hear what is said? It\u0092s worth noting here that while Luke agrees that there was a single blind man (Luke 18:35), Matthew recorded the presence of two blind men (Matthew 20:30).\nI think it\u0092s important to understand that it probably wasn\u0092t meant to be read literally in the first place. Making the blind see again appears to be a way of talking about getting Israel to \u0093see\u0094 again in a spiritual sense. Jesus is coming to \u0093awaken\u0094 Israel and cure them of their inability to properly see what God wants of them.\nThe blind man\u0092s faith in Jesus is what allowed him to be healed. Similarly, Israel will be healed so long as they have faith in Jesus and God. Unfortunately, it is also a consistent theme in Mark and the other gospels that the Jews lack faith in Jesus \u0097 and that lack of faith is what prevents them from understanding who Jesus really is and what he has come to do.\nQuestion:\nIn the Bible, who was the blind beggar that Jesus cured in Jericho?\nAnswer:\nBartimeus\nPassage:\nLuge the Sport - Topend Sports\nLuge the Sport\nHome > Sports > List > Luge\nLuge\nLuge is a  Winter Olympic sport. It uses a small one or two-person sled, on which the participants slide down the mountain face  up and feet first. Racing sleds weigh around twenty one to twenty five kilograms  for singles, and twenty five to thirty kilograms for doubles. The lugers can  read the speed of up to 140 kilometers per hour.\nThe term luge was first used in 1905. It\u2019s from the French Savoy/Swiss  dialect which means small coasting sled. The governing body for Luge is the Federation Internationale de Luge de Course.  A team consisting of one or two can play. Both men and women can play but  usually in separate competitions.\nLuge is held on either artificial tracks or  natural tracks. Natural tracks are on existing mountain roads and paths. The  participants equip themselves with a sled, helmet, suit, visor, gloves, finger  spikes, and booties. The four luge disciplines are: men\u2019s singles, doubles or  mixed event, women\u2019s singles, and team relay which is now an Olympic discipline.\nShare:\nQuestion:\nVisors, gloves and finger spikes are worn in which Olympic sport?\nAnswer:\nLugeing\n\n```\n\nQuestion: Passage:\nGreat Britain - Hanover - King George III & Charlotte of ...\n1000+ images about Great Britain - Hanover - King George III & Charlotte of Mecklenburg on Pinterest | King george, Charlotte and Children\nForward\nCharlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz was the Queen of the United Kingdom as wife of King George III.
