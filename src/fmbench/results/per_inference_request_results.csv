Passage 1:
Huernia
The genus Huernia (family Apocynaceae, subfamily Asclepiadoideae) consists of perennial, stem succulents from Eastern and Southern Africa and Arabia, first described as a genus in 1810.The flowers are five-lobed, usually somewhat more funnel- or bell-shaped than in the closely related genus Stapelia, and often striped vividly in contrasting colors or tones, some glossy, others matte and wrinkled depending on the species concerned. Frequently the flowers are colored a variation of red, yellow or brown. To pollinate, the flowers attract flies by emitting a scent similar to that of carrion. The genus is considered close to the genera Stapelia and Hoodia. Phylogenetic studies have shown the genus to be monophyletic, and most closely related to the genus Tavaresia, and to a widespread branch of stapeliads comprising the genera Orbea, Piaranthus and Stapelia.The name of the plant is in honor of Justus van Heurne (1587–1653?) a Dutch missionary, botanist, and doctor, who is reputed to have been the first European to document and collect South African Cape plants. His surname has variations (van Horne, Heurnius, van Heurnius), however it was misspelled by the plant collector.Various species of Huernia are considered famine food by the inhabitants of Konso special woreda in southern Ethiopia. The local inhabitants, who call the native species of this genus baqibaqa indiscriminately, eat it with prepared balls of sorghum (kurkufa); they note that baqibaqa tastes relatively good and has no unpleasant side-effects when boiled and consumed. As a result, local farmers encouraged it to grow on stone walls forming the terraces, where it does not compete with other crops.

Species
The follow species of Huernia are found in Africa (East Africa, South Africa and Ethiopia) and Arabia (Saudi Arabia, Yemen).

Passage 2:
Dictyosperma
Dictyosperma is a monotypic genus of flowering plant in the palm family found in the Mascarene Islands in the Indian Ocean (Mauritius, Réunion and Rodrigues). The sole species, Dictyosperma album, is widely cultivated in the tropics but has been farmed to near extinction in its native habitat. It is commonly called princess palm or hurricane palm, the latter owing to its ability to withstand strong winds by easily shedding leaves. It is closely related to, and resembles, palms in the genus Archontophoenix. The genus is named from two Greek words meaning ""net"" and ""seed"" and the epithet is Latin for ""white"", the common color of the crownshaft at the top of the trunk.

Description
The ringed trunks are solitary at 15 cm in diameter with a slight bulge at the base, occasionally reaching up to 12 m in height. The crownshaft is over a meter tall, swollen at the base, and covered in white wax— which has given the palm its epithet album— and small, matted brown hairs, producing a rounded leaf crown 4.5 m wide and 3 m tall. The 2.5 to 3 m leaves are borne on short 30 cm petioles; the arching leaflets are pointed at the apice, from 60 – 90 cm, dark green in color, and emerge from the rachis in a single plane.
On flowering, they produce up to six inflorescences which ring the trunk below the crownshaft, branched to one order, with white to yellow flowers, which are male and female; both pistillate and staminate flowers have three sepals and three petals, the former being smaller than the latter. The ovoid fruit ripen to purple or black in color, containing one brown, ellipsoidal seed.
Three varieties are currently recognized:

Dictyosperma album var. album (Bory) Scheff. - Mauritius, Réunion
Dictyosperma album var. aureum Balf.f. in J.G.Baker - Rodrigues Island
Dictyosperma album var. conjugatum H.E.Moore & J.Guého - 2 remaining specimens on Île Ronde of Mauritius (Characterised by shorter trunk and white leaf-scar)

Distribution and habitat
Living in the coastal forests of the Mascarenes, they experience warm temperatures, high humidity and regular rainfall.

Asterolecanium dictyospermae
Asterolecanium dictyospermae is a species of sap sucking scale insect found only on Île Ronde on the two remaining Dictyosperma album var. conjugatum specimens. It apparently evolved on Île Ronde and became restricted to feeding upon the island's endemic variety, and due to interbreeding (between varieties) on Mauritius itself which jeopardized reproductive potential, the scale insect increased in population as a result of stress upon the host, which then threatens the existence of both host and scale insect.

Passage:
Jesus Heals Blind Bartimeus (Mark 10:46-52) - Analysis
Jesus Heals Blind Bartimeus (Mark 10:46-52) - Analysis
By Austin Cline
Updated September 11, 2016.
46 And they came to Jericho : and as he went out of Jericho with his disciples and a great number of people, blind Bartimaeus, the son of Timaeus, sat by the highway side begging. 47 And when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth , he began to cry out, and say, Jesus, thou son of David, have mercy on me.
48 And many charged him that he should hold his peace: but he cried the more a great deal, Thou son of David, have mercy on me. 49 And Jesus stood still, and commanded him to be called. And they call the blind man, saying unto him, Be of good comfort, rise; he calleth thee. 50 And he, casting away his garment, rose, and came to Jesus.
51 And Jesus answered and said unto him, What wilt thou that I should do unto thee? The blind man said unto him, Lord, that I might receive my sight. 52 And Jesus said unto him, Go thy way; thy faith hath made thee whole. And immediately he received his sight, and followed Jesus in the way.
Compare: Matthew 20:29-34; Luke 18:35-43
Jesus, Son of David?
Jericho is on the way to Jerusalem for Jesus, but apparently nothing of interest happened while he was there. Upon leaving, however, Jesus encountered another blind man who had faith that he would be able to cure his blindness. This isnt the first time Jesus cured a blind man and its unlikely that this incident was meant to be read any more literally than previous ones.
I wonder why, at the beginning, people tried to stop the blind man from calling out to Jesus. Im sure that he must have had quite a reputation as a healer by this point  enough of one that the blind man himself was obviously well aware of who he was and what he might be able to do. If that is the case, then why would people try to stop him? Could it have anything to do with him being in Judea  is it possible that the people here are not happy about Jesus?
It should be noted that this is one of the few times so far that Jesus has been identified with Nazareth. In fact, the only other two times so far came during the first chapter. In verse nine we can read  Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee  and then later when Jesus is casting out unclean spirits in Capernaum , one of the spirits identifies him as thou Jesus of Nazareth. This blind man, then, is only the second to ever identify Jesus as such  and hes not exactly in good company.
This is also the first time that Jesus is identified as a son of David. It was foretold that the Messiah would come from the House of David, but so far Jesus lineage has not been mentioned at all (Mark is the gospel without any information about Jesus family and birth). It seems reasonable to conclude that Mark had to introduce that bit of information at some point and this is as good as any. The reference may also harken back to David returning to Jerusalem to claim his kingdom as described in 2 Samuel 19-20.
Isnt it odd that Jesus asks him what he wants? Even if Jesus werent God (and, therefore, omniscient ), but simply a miracle worker wandering around curing peoples ailments, it has to be obvious to him what a blind man rushing up to him might want. Isnt it rather demeaning to force the man to say it? Does he just want people in the crowd to hear what is said? Its worth noting here that while Luke agrees that there was a single blind man (Luke 18:35), Matthew recorded the presence of two blind men (Matthew 20:30).
I think its important to understand that it probably wasnt meant to be read literally in the first place. Making the blind see again appears to be a way of talking about getting Israel to see again in a spiritual sense. Jesus is coming to awaken Israel and cure them of their inability to properly see what God wants of them.
The blind mans faith in Jesus is what allowed him to be healed. Similarly, Israel will be healed so long as they have faith in Jesus and God. Unfortunately, it is also a consistent theme in Mark and the other gospels that the Jews lack faith in Jesus  and that lack of faith is what prevents them from understanding who Jesus really is and what he has come to do.
Question:
In the Bible, who was the blind beggar that Jesus cured in Jericho?
Answer:
Bartimeus

Luge
Luge is a  Winter Olympic sport. It uses a small one or two-person sled, on which the participants slide down the mountain face  up and feet first. Racing sleds weigh around twenty one to twenty five kilograms  for singles, and twenty five to thirty kilograms for doubles. The lugers can  read the speed of up to 140 kilometers per hour.
The term luge was first used in 1905. It’s from the French Savoy/Swiss  dialect which means small coasting sled. The governing body for Luge is the Federation Internationale de Luge de Course.  A team consisting of one or two can play. Both men and women can play but  usually in separate competitions.
Luge is held on either artificial tracks or  natural tracks. Natural tracks are on existing mountain roads and paths. The  participants equip themselves with a sled, helmet, suit, visor, gloves, finger  spikes, and booties. The four luge disciplines are: men’s singles, doubles or  mixed event, women’s singles, and team relay which is now an Olympic discipline.

nothing but net
Nothing but net is the name of an entire category of some of the most intimate sexual positions. The criteria that a sexual position must meet in order to be considered part of the nothing but net category is rigidly defined as any position such that only genitals are touching.
Paying homage to its namesake, it is considered top form to make a ""swish"" sound at the outset of a nothing but net position. Neglecting to ""swish"" at adequate volume greatly increases risk of penile fracture.
For a couple containing a male that is not well endowed, it is likely that only limited exploration of the nothing but net category will take place due to anatomical restrictions only permitting a just the tip (or JT squared) scenario.

Passage:
Bematist
Bematists or bematistae (Ancient Greek βηματισταί, from 
βῆμα bema 'pace'), were specialists in ancient Greece who were trained to measure distances by counting their steps. 
Measurements of Alexander's bematists

Bematists accompanied Alexander the Great on his campaign in Asia. Their measurements of the distances traveled by Alexander's army show a high degree of precision to the point that it had been suggested that they must have used an odometer, although there is no direct mentioning of such a device: 

 

The table below lists distances of the routes as measured by two of Alexander's bematists, Diognetus and Baeton. They were recorded in Pliny's Naturalis Historia  (NH 6.61–62). Another similar set of measurements is given by Strabo (11.8.9) following Eratosthenes.   

Notes:
1) 1 mille passus = 1,480 meters or 1,618.5 yards 
2) 1 Attic stadion =  606’10’’ 
3) The route is not recorded to have been followed by Alexander himself.

Addenda: Leaving out the highest outlier each, the average deviation of the rest of the bematists's measurements would be 1.9% with Pliny and 1.5% with Strabo at a measured distance of 1,958 respectively 1,605 miles.

List of bematists 

* Amyntas 
* Baeton
* Diognetus
* Philonides of Chersonissos

A+E Networks
After 19 years of imprisonment, Mary Queen of Scots is beheaded at Fotheringhay Castle in England for her complicity in a plot to murder Queen Elizabeth I.
In 1542, while just six days old, Mary ascended to the Scottish throne upon the death of her father, King James V. Her mother sent her to be raised in the French court, and in 1558 she married the French dauphin, who became King Francis II of France in 1559 but died the following year. After Francis’ death, Mary returned to Scotland to assume her designated role as the country’s monarch.
In 1565, she married her English cousin Lord Darnley in order to reinforce her claim of succession to the English throne after Elizabeth’s death. In 1567, Darnley was mysteriously killed in an explosion at Kirk o’ Field, and Mary’s lover, the Earl of Bothwell, was the key suspect. Although Bothwell was acquitted of the charge, his marriage to Mary in the same year enraged the nobility. Mary brought an army against the nobles, but was defeated and imprisoned at Lochleven, Scotland, and forced to abdicate in favor of her son by Darnley, James.
In 1568, Mary escaped from captivity and raised a substantial army but was defeated and fled to England. Queen Elizabeth initially welcomed Mary but was soon forced to put her friend under house arrest after Mary became the focus of various English Catholic and Spanish plots to overthrow Elizabeth. Nineteen years later, in 1586, a major plot to murder Elizabeth was reported, and Mary was brought to trial. She was convicted for complicity and sentenced to death.
On February 8, 1587, Mary Queen of Scots was beheaded for treason. Her son, King James VI of Scotland, calmly accepted his mother’s execution, and upon Queen Elizabeth’s death in 1603 he became king of England, Scotland, and Ireland.

Passage:
Gil Eanes
Gil Eanes (or Eannes, in the old Portuguese spelling;) was a 15th-century Portuguese navigator and explorer.

Eanes was born in Lagos  in 1395. Little is known about his personal life prior to his role in the Portuguese Age of Discovery, and was considered a household servant and shield-bearer of the Infante Henry the Navigator. He was a native of Lagos on which he based his sea voyages, in the southern Algarve.  

He joined the service of Prince Henry's expeditions in 1433, when the Infante entrusted him with a vessel and crew, in order to attempt to round Cape Bojador, an impassable cape, with the then level of knowledge and equipment.  Sailing from Lagos, Portugal, Eanes made an unknown number of voyages along the west coast of Africa, before being driven west towards the Canary Islands.  In the islands he captured some inoffensive natives and returned with them as captives to Sagres, excusing his failure by recounting the dangers of the trip. His return was greeted with reserve and coldness in the court of Prince Henry, who had expected the navigator to succeed in rounding the Cape. Eanes hoped to return to favour in the following year, if the Prince would favour him with a second expedition. In 1434, his barquentine-caravel and crew was able to sail beyond Cape Bojador and return to Sagres, reporting the conditions of the water, land and ease of navigation beyond the Cape, and bringing with him some wild roses to prove that they had succeeded in their expedition.  The discovery of a passable route around Cape Bojador marked the beginning of the Portuguese exploration of Africa. 

Eanes made another voyage, with Afonso Gonçalves Baldaia, in 1435. They sailed about 30 leagues (144 km), or even 50 leagues (240 km) south of Cape Bojador and reached the African coast. Although they did not discover any inhabitants immediately, they did find traces of a human presence, during a voyage that was considered favourable. They named the bay in which they anchored Angra dos Ruivos (Cove of Reds), for the abundance of fish (resembling gurnets) that they caught in the waters.
Question:
In 1434, Portuguese mariner Gil Eanes made a major breakthrough to obtain a reliable trade route to Western and Eastern Africa and India by finding a route around which cape?
Answer:
Cabo Bojador
Passage:
Webb Ellis Cup
The Webb Ellis Cup is the trophy awarded to the winner of the Rugby World Cup, the premier competition in men's international rugby union. The Cup is named after William Webb Ellis, who is often credited as the inventor of rugby football. The trophy is silver gilt and has been presented to the winner of the Rugby World Cup since the first competition in 1987. It has been held thrice by New Zealand (1987, 2011 & 2015), twice by Australia (1991 & 1999) and South Africa (1995 & 2007), and once by  England in 2003.

The 38 centimetre trophy weighs 4.5 kg, is gilded silver and is supported by two cast scroll handles.  On one handle there is a head of a satyr, on the other there is the head of a nymph. On the face of the trophy, the words International Rugby Football Board and below that arch The Webb Ellis Cup are engraved. The Webb Ellis Cup is also referred to (incorrectly) as the ""Webb Ellis Trophy"" or colloquially as ""Bill"", a nickname coined by the 1991 Rugby World Cup winners, the Wallabies.

History

There are two official Webb Ellis Cups, which are used interchangeably. One cup is a 1906 trophy made by Carrington and Co. of London, which was a Victorian design of a 1740s cup by Paul de Lamerie, while the other is a 1986 replica.

John Kendall-Carpenter, former England forward and the organiser of the first Rugby World Cup and Bob Weighill, the secretary of the International Rugby Board also a former England forward, visited Garrard & Co, the crown jeweller in Regent Street, London. Director Richard Jarvis, brought the particular cup down from the vault and showed it to both of them.

It was chosen for use in February 1987. Ronnie Dawson of Ireland, Keith Rowlands of Wales, Bob Stuart and  Dick Littlejohn of New Zealand and the Australians Nick Shehadie and Ross Turnbull approved of the choice of the trophy.  The trophy is being cared for and restored after each game by silversmiths Thomas Lyte.  

It was soon named ""The Webb Ellis Cup"". New Zealand became the first nation to win the Webb Ellis Cup when they won the 1987 Rugby World Cup. The Webb Ellis Cup has been held by four nations; New Zealand, Australia, South Africa and England.

The current holders are New Zealand after beating Australia 34–17 in the 2015 Final in England. The trophy was on display in Newlands, South Africa until 2007, where it had stayed for two years following their victory. Later it was returned to the home of World Rugby, Ireland. One cup recently went on tour around the New Zealand provinces along with the Dave Gallaher Trophy, Bledisloe Cup, Hillary Shield, Women's World Cup, Rugby Sevens World Series and the Junior World Cup trophies.

Passage:
Juliet (moon)
There is also an asteroid called 1285 Julietta.

Juliet (  or ) is an inner satellite of Uranus. It was discovered from the images taken by Voyager 2 on 3 January 1986, and was given the temporary designation S/1986 U 2. It is named after the heroine of William Shakespeare's play Romeo and Juliet. It is also designated Uranus XI.

Juliet belongs to Portia Group of satellites, which also includes Bianca, Cressida, Desdemona, Portia, Rosalind, Cupid, Belinda and Perdita. These satellites have similar orbits and photometric properties. Unfortunately, other than its orbit, radius of 53 km and geometric albedo of 0.08 virtually nothing is known about Juliet.

At the Voyager 2 images Juliet appears as an elongated object, the major axis pointing towards Uranus. The ratio of axes of Juliet's prolate spheroid is 0.5 ± 0.3, which is rather an extreme value. Its surface is grey in color.

Juliet may collide with Desdemona within the next 100 million years.
Question:
Juliet, Cupid and Desdemona are moons of which planet?
Answer:
Magnetosphere of Uranus
Passage:
Black Canyon of the Colorado
The Black Canyon of the Colorado is the canyon on the Colorado River where Hoover Dam was built. The canyon is located on the Colorado River at the state line between Nevada and Arizona. The western wall of the gorge is in the El Dorado Mountains, and the eastern wall is in the Black Mountains of Arizona. The canyon formed about 15 million years ago during the Miocene Basin and Range uplift.[http://www.birdandhike.com/Wilderness/BlackCyn/_Black.htm Black Canyon Wilderness Area] Information on Black Canyon and its natural history. Black Canyon gets its name from the black volcanic rocks that are found throughout the area.

Just south of the Hoover Dam on the Nevada side of the canyon is the Sauna Cave. This cave was drilled by miners working on Hoover Dam while it was being constructed. It is a deep cave with calcium carbonate crystals on the walls. At the end of the cave is a hot spring, which causes temperatures in the cave to reach 120 F.

One prominent canyon that splits from this canyon south of the Hoover Dam is Boy Scout Canyon. Boy Scout Canyon has water running through it that is warmed from a geothermal source.

On the Arizona side of the river, there are several large hot springs that can be found by taking a trail north from a larger bay about 4 to south of the Hoover Dam.
Question:
What is the dam in the Black Canyon of the Colorado River on the border between the US states of Arizona and Nevada that was completed in 1935?

How to Make Triple Sec
Posted by Shelly Bowen on Oct 8, 2009 in Handcrafted Mixers , How to ... | No Comments
When it comes to mixing fantastic drinks, fewer things make it better than having the best ingredients on hand. Triple sec or orange liqueur (or Grand Marnier or Cointreau, both orange liqueurs) is widely used in many classics, so we made own special version.
What does triple sec taste like? Triple sec is a sweet orange citrus liqueur. Our homemade triple sec tastes heavily of oranges and orange peel, like orange hard candy. Some triple secs are not as potently orange tasting.
This recipe comes from Charlie Hodges at the Ace Hotel, Palm Springs, via Imbibe Magazine‘s Fall 2009 issue. Read through the steps and you’ll see that you can multitask to speed up the process.
Here’s what you need to make triple sec:
4 small navel oranges
12 oz. Everclear grain alcohol
12 oz. vodka
12 oz. can of Mandarin orange slices
5 cups cane sugar
Orange blossom water
Get all your triple sec ingredients together, then:
Heat oven to lowest temperature setting, generally around 180ºF – 200ºF. Slice the oranges into 1/8″ thick wheels and lay out on a baking tray. Bake oranges until sticky and gummy but not dried, about 1-2 hours.
Drain the can of Mandarin oranges and place in a jar with the vodka to infuse for about 24 hours or until it tastes strongly of the oranges.
Combine the baked orange slices with the Everclear and infuse for 8 hours, stirring occasionally.
Make the simple syrup combining the sugar and water and stirring over medium heat until dissolved.
Finally, strain all liquid ingredients through a fine sieve and combine with the syrup. Stir and add a few dashes of orange blossom water to taste. Bottle it up and it keeps refrigerated for about a month.
Ready to mix? Here are some mixed drink recipes that call for triple sec.

Passage:
Gland
A gland is an organ in an animal's body that synthesizes substances (such as hormones) for release into the bloodstream (endocrine gland) or into cavities inside the body or its outer surface (exocrine gland).

Structure

Development

Every gland is formed by an ingrowth from an epithelial surface. This ingrowth may in the beginning possess a tubular structure, but in other instances glands may start as a solid column of cells which subsequently becomes tubulated.

As growth proceeds, the column of cells may divide or give off offshoots, in which case a compound gland is formed. In many glands, the number of branches is limited, in others (salivary, pancreas) a very large structure is finally formed by repeated growth and sub-division. As a rule, the branches do not unite with one another, but in one instance, the liver, this does occur when a reticulated compound gland is produced. In compound glands the more typical or secretory epithelium is found forming the terminal portion of each branch, and the uniting portions form ducts and are lined with a less modified type of epithelial cell.

Glands are classified according to their shape.
* If the gland retains its shape as a tube throughout it is termed a tubular gland.
* In the second main variety of gland the secretory portion is enlarged and the lumen variously increased in size. These are termed alveolar or saccular glands.

Function

Glands are divided based on their function into two groups:

Endocrine glands

Endocrine glands secrete substances that circulate through the blood stream. These glands that secrete their products through the basal lamina into the blood stream and lack a duct system. These glands often secrete hormones, and play an important role in maintaining homeostasis. The pineal gland, thymus gland, pituitary gland, thyroid gland, and the two adrenal glands are all endocrine glands.

Exocrine glands
 

Exocrine glands secrete their products through a duct onto an outer surface of the body, such as the skin or the human gastrointestinal tract. Secretion is directly onto the apical surface. The glands in this group can be divided into three groups:
* Apocrine glands a portion of the secreting cell's body is lost during secretion. Apocrine gland is often used to refer to the apocrine sweat glands, however it is thought that apocrine sweat glands may not be true apocrine glands as they may not use the apocrine method of secretion. e.g. mammery gland, sweat gland of arm pit, pubic region, skin around anus, lips, nipples.
* Holocrine glands the entire cell disintegrates to secrete its substances (e.g., sebaceous glands)sebaceous, meibomiun & zeis gland.
* Merocrine glands cells secrete their substances by exocytosis (e.g., mucous and serous glands). Also called ""eccrine"". e.g. max sweat gland of humans, goblet cells, salivary gland, tear gland, intestinal glands.

The type of secretory product of exocrine glands may also be one of three categories:
* Serous glands secrete a watery, often protein-rich, fluid-like product, e.g. sweat glands.
* Mucous glands secrete a viscous product, rich in carbohydrates (such as glycoproteins), e.g. goblet cells.
* Sebaceous glands secrete a lipid product. These glands are also known as oil glands, e.g. Fordyce spots and meibomian glands.

Passage:
Bridal Chorus
The ""Bridal Chorus"" () from the 1850 opera Lohengrin by German composer Richard Wagner is a march played for the bride's entrance at many formal weddings throughout the Western world. In English-speaking countries it is generally known as ""Here Comes the Bride"" or ""Wedding March"", though ""wedding march"" refers to any piece in march tempo accompanying the entrance or exit of the bride, notably Felix Mendelssohn's ""Wedding March"". The piece was made popular when it was used as the processional at the wedding of Victoria the Princess Royal to Prince Frederick William of Prussia in 1858. 

The chorus is sung in Lohengrin by the women of the wedding party after the ceremony, as they accompany the heroine Elsa to the bridal chamber.

Text

Although at most weddings the chorus is usually played on an organ without vocal singing, in Lohengrin the wedding party sings these words at the beginning of act three.

Eight women then sing a blessing to a separate melody.

The chorus then repeats the first section, gradually proceeding offstage.

Religious attitudes 

Many pastors of the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod oppose the ""Bridal Chorus"" because of both pre-First World War Lutheran opposition to the theater and the pagan elements of Wagner's operas.  The Roman Catholic Church generally does not use the ""Bridal Chorus""; one diocese's guidelines regarding the chorus states that the chorus is a secular piece of music, that it is not a processional to the altar in the opera, and especially that its frequent use in film and television associate it with sentimentality rather than worship.  The song is also not used in Eastern Orthodox weddings.
Question:
Which composer wrote the ‘Bridal Chorus’, popularly known as ‘Here Comes the Bride’?
Answer:
Wagner's

Passage:
Mirin
is an essential condiment used in Japanese cuisine.  It is a type of rice wine similar to sake, but with a lower alcohol content and higher sugar content.  The sugar content is a complex carbohydrate formed naturally via the fermentation process; it is not refined sugar. The alcohol content is further lowered when the liquid is heated.

There are three general types of mirin. The first is hon mirin (literally: true mirin),  which contains approximately 14% alcohol and is  produced by a forty- to sixty-day mashing (saccharification) process.   The second is shio mirin, which contains alcohol as low as 1.5% to avoid alcohol tax.  The third is shin mirin (literally: new mirin),  or mirin-fu chomiryo (literally: mirin-like seasoning), which contains less than 1% alcohol yet retains the same flavor.

In the Edo period, mirin was consumed as Amazake.  Otoso, traditionally consumed on Shōgatsu, can be made by soaking a spice mixture in mirin. 

In the Kansai style of cooking, mirin is briefly boiled before using, to allow some of the alcohol to evaporate, while in the Kantō regional style, the mirin is used untreated. Kansai-style boiled mirin is called nikiri mirin ()  (literally: thoroughly boiled mirin).

Mirin is used to add a bright touch to grilled (broiled) fish or to erase the fishy smell. A small amount is often used instead of sugar and soy sauce. It should not be used in excess, however, as its flavor is quite strong. It is sometimes used to accompany sushi. Mirin is used in teriyaki sauce. 

November 30 has been designated the Day of hon-mirin by the mirin industry because in Japanese wordplay the date words sound like '11' (, good) and '30' (, mirin).

Passage:
Slowhand
Slowhand is the fifth studio album released by the British recording artist Eric Clapton. It was released on 25 November in 1977 by RSO Records. The release, titled after Clapton's nickname, is to this date one of his both commercially and musically most successful studio albums. Slowhand produced the two hit singles ""Lay Down Sally"" and ""Wonderful Tonight"", reached various international music charts and was honored with numerous awards and recording certifications. In 2012, a deluxe edition was released to celebrate the album's 35th anniversary.

Recording

Clapton wanted to work with record producer Glyn Johns, because he thought Johns produced great work with famous groups like The Rolling Stones and The Eagles and understands how to work with both British and American musicians. While in the studio with Johns, Clapton notes that the A-list producer was very disciplined and disliked jamming, because it would kill important recording time. Although Clapton and his band were either drunk or stoned nearly all the time when recording, Johns liked Clapton's work and brought out the best in every musician, according to Clapton. 

Title and artwork

The album was titled after Clapton's nickname, which was given to him by Giorgio Gomelsky. In his 2007 autobiography, Clapton recalled that the name ""Slowhand"" seemed to be hanging on to his real name, because it seemed to be well received by both his American friends and fans who think of the wild west when hearing the nickname. The album's artwork was done by Clapton himself with the help of Pattie Boyd and Dave Stewart, credited as ""El & Nell Ink"". Besides choosing various photos for the inner side of the gramophone record packaging are two pictures, Clapton notes, which have deeper importance to him: one picture, in which he kisses Boyd and another photograph showing a demolished Ferrari 365 GT4 BB, which Clapton bought after seeing George Harrison turning up with the same model at his Hurtwood Edge Estate. The car, which has been involved with Clapton in a car accident after the British recording artist finished touring in Australia, nearly killed him.

Release and reception

Slowhand was released on 25 November 1977 by RSO Records.  In a contemporary review for Rolling Stone, John Swenson found Clapton's playing more subtle than before but his songs sobering and interesting psychologically, especially ""Next Time You See Her"", as they showed him ""in touch with the horrible moral power and long-suffering self-righteousness that is the essence of the blues"".  Robert Christgau was less enthusiastic, lamenting how most of the record's best guitar solos were played by George Terry and feeling Clapton had regressed as a singer, ""sounding like he's blown his voice. Doing what, I wonder.""

In a retrospective review for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote that the confident, virtuosic quality in the band's playing and the diversity of the songwriting made Slowhand ""rank with 461 Ocean Boulevard as Eric Clapton's best albums"". Yahoo! Music's Dave DiMartino said the record was full of hits and ""tasteful"" music.  In 2003, Slowhand was ranked number 325 on Rolling Stones list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. 

Censure in Argentina

The rock song ""Cocaine"" was censored and removed from the Argentinian edition of the album in late 1977. The military government of the time claimed that the song Clapton recorded was harmful to young people and inviting them to get high. The ban was finally lifted in 1984. Clapton felt indignation in later years after learning of censorship, since ""Cocaine"" is a song which is against drugs, and not to please as many people think. The musician once said that it is useless to intentionally write a song that goes against drugs and hope that people grasp the meaning. In ""Cocaine,"" an anti-drug perspective is communicated more effectively through an honest song whose cautionary message is apparent upon reflection.  After several years, Clapton began including the phrase 'that dirty cocaine' in live performances to highlight the anti-drug message of the song.  In addition, Clapton donated much of their funds to Crossroads Centre, a center that helps drug addicts to fight to stop drugs and rehabilitate themselves. 

Deluxe Edition

In November 2012, a remastered two-compact-disc 35th anniversary deluxe edition of Slowhand was released. The first disc consists of the remastered album, with additional bonus tracks and studio jam sessions. The second disc features a previously unreleased live concert, recorded in April 1977 at the Hammersmith Odeon; although the concert is of the same era as the Slowhand sessions, it was performed prior to the album's recording and release, and so does not include any of the album's tracks.

Passage:
Red Lake Mine
The Red Lake mine is one of the largest gold mines in Canada and in the world.  The mine is located in northwestern Ontario at Red Lake. The mine has estimated reserves of 3.23 million oz of gold.

The Red Lake Mining District has produced over 22 million ounces of gold through 2004, worth over $US 35 billion at 2014 prices. The two principal mines, Campbell and Red Lake, both have historic ore grades averaging about 0.57 oz/ton Au (22 g/tonne). 

The rocks and mineralization features in this district are complex. The host rock here is a metamorphosed tholeiitic basalt dating to ~2.85 billion years (early Neoarchean). This basalt has been subjected to biotite-carbonate alteration and auriferous silicification. Gold mineralization has been dated to 2.712-2.723 billion years (during collision-related emplacement of several nearby igneous intrusions - Uchian Phase of the Kenoran Orogeny), and  at 2.63-2.66 or 2.699 billion years (during a regional thermal event or another igneous intrusive event).
Question:
The Red Lake Mine, said to produce the richest gold ore in the world is in which country?
Answer:
Canada
